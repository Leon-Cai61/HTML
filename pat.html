	<p> Patrol aircraft, also known as maritime patrol aircraft or surveillance aircraft, are specialized platforms designed for conducting long-duration patrols and surveillance missions over large bodies of water. These aircraft are primarily employed for maritime surveillance, reconnaissance, and monitoring operations, often in support of naval or coastal security missions. The main mission of patrol aircraft is to conduct surveillance and reconnaissance over the oceans, seas, or littoral regions to detect, track, and identify surface vessels, submarines, aircraft, and other maritime threats. These aircraft are equipped with a variety of sensors and systems to gather intelligence, monitor maritime activities, enforce maritime laws, and support search and rescue operations. Patrol aircraft are designed for extended endurance and long-range operations. They have the capability to cover vast areas and loiter for extended periods, allowing them to effectively patrol and monitor maritime zones of interest. These aircraft often feature extended fuel capacity, advanced avionics, and enhanced communication systems to support their surveillance and reconnaissance tasks. The sensors and systems aboard patrol aircraft can include radar systems, electro-optical/infrared cameras, magnetic anomaly detectors (MAD), and acoustic sensors for detecting and tracking surface vessels and submarines. They may also carry equipment for signals intelligence (SIGINT) to intercept and analyze electronic communications or identify electronic emissions from maritime targets. Patrol aircraft serve as vital platforms for maritime domain awareness, providing situational awareness and valuable information to naval forces or coast guard agencies. They assist in detecting illegal activities, such as smuggling, piracy, or unauthorized fishing, and contribute to maintaining the security and integrity of territorial waters or exclusive economic zones. These aircraft can also perform additional roles such as search and rescue operations, environmental monitoring, and support for humanitarian missions. They may be equipped with equipment for dropping life rafts or delivering emergency supplies to vessels in distress or in remote locations. In military applications, patrol aircraft can support anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations by detecting and tracking submarines, as well as anti-surface warfare (ASuW) missions by identifying and monitoring surface vessels. They can also act as airborne command and control platforms, coordinating and directing maritime assets in complex operational scenarios.</p>
